Hi, I'm Saleh! I have a background in philosophy and data science. I'm a PhD candidate in AI ethics at The State University of New York, and I hold a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in analytic philosophy. I'm also currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S) degree in data science at the University of Austin.

With over 8 years of research experience in interdisciplinary fields, my recent research projects have focused on the intersection of individual and social values, data, and machine learning.
